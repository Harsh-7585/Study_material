SPI driver registration --- helper macro 
    - module_spi_driver(&spi_driver);
    - This macro internally creates a `module_init()` fn which in turn register our driver using `spi_register_driver()` 
    - This macro also creates a `module_exit()` fn which in turn unregister the driver.

                                                                    
I2C driver registration --- helper macro
    - module_i2c_driver(&i2c_driver);

USB driver registration --- helper macro 
    - module_usb_driver(&usb_driver);

Platform driver registration --- helper macro 
    - module_platform_driver(&driver);
