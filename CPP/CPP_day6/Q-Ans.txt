Q1: Why Static function never be virtual?
Answer - > It is not possible, even I say it is not meaningful. 
Because A static member function is something that does not relate to any object, It a class level entity.
and Virtual functions are invoked when you have a pointer of base class and object is of a class. 
So we may say virtual function are call by using object and static function wont required any object to call.

Q2: Why we can not declare static member function constant?
Answer -> Constant function cannot change the state of object (value of data members) like display() or print() so this function are related to object
By using object we need call const function.
A static member function is something that does not relate to any object, 
It a class level entity and the main use of static function is to update static data member.

Q3: Why global function we can not declare as const?
Answer: -> Constant function cannot change the state of object (value of data members) like display() or print() so this function are related to object
As global function are not related to any object so global function never be const.
Even in C lang all the functions are global so there is no concept of const function.

Q4: What is "this" pointer? Is it available for static, virtual, const and friend functions?
Answer: -> "this pointer" is a address of current or calling object. It is passed as implicit argument to the member function.
In static function "this pointer" is not available because they are not related to any object
In virtual function "this pointer" is available
In const function "this pointer" is available
In friend function "this pointer" is not available because they are not member function of class
